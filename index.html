      <p>Hello and welcome to my page, my name is Minh Pham and I am currently enrolled in the University of Central Florida's Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp. Up until this point we have covered a vast amount of topics that were all foreign to me prior to attending this bootcamp.</p>

      <p>Thanks to the amazing staff here at UCF's bootcamp, we dove right in beginning with git concepts, basic html, and css. Roughly after week two we were informed that the real challenge was just beginning and if we struggled with HTML and CSS that we were totally screwed!</p>

      <p>Entering into even more unknown territory, the manipulation of HTML and CSS using JavaScript and JQuery. </p>
